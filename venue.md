### Conference Format
The conference will be hybrid, but primarily focused on in-person attendance.
**In-person presentations are strongly encouraged!**
If in-person attendance is not possible, remote (live only) presentations will be allowed.
The registration costs for paper presenters will be the same, regardless of in-person/online attendance.
On the other hand, to maximize potential audience, the conference will offer free online access to non-presenters.

### Workshops
SIGdial-INLG associated workshops are free to choose their own format.
Some of them may be hybrid, but some will be in-person only.
