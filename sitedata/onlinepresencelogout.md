### Please Register & Login to Unlock the Online Presence 

**You first need to [register](registration.html) for the conference** in order to access the online features of SIGDIAL & INLG 2023. Online registration is free for non-presenters.

**After your register, please use the `Log in` button** on the top right of any page on this website. On mobile devices, `Log in` is the last category in the main menu.
Logging-in is required for access to Discord, Zoom, or to download camera ready papers in pdf format.

To log in, please **use the same e-mail you used for conference registration on Eventbrite**. When you open the log-in screen for the first time, simply click `Sign up` and choose a password. Only emails registered on Eventbrite will be allowed to proceed. You then need to confirm your account by clicking a link sent to you by email.

#### Known Problems

* **`Prevent Cross-Site Tracking` needs to be turned-off:** The [Auth0 authentication service](https://auth0.com/), which is used for logins, needs to use cross-site tracking since it allows logging to this website, but it handles the authentication under its own [auth0.com](https://auth0.com/) domain.


If you have questions regarding authentication for this website, please contact <a href="https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/ondrej-platek">Ondrej Platek</a>.
