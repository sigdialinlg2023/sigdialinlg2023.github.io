## Known Problems

####  `Prevent Cross-Site Tracking` needs to be turned-off
Why? The authentication service `auth0.com` needs to use cross-site tracking since it allows logging to https://sigdialinlg2023.github.io/ domain but handles authentication under it's own auth0.com domain.


If you have questions regarding authentication for this website, please contact <a href="https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/ondrej-platek">Ondrej Platek</a>.
