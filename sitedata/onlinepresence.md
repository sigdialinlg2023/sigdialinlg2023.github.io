## Online Tools for In-Person and Virtual Conference

### Chat on Discord

**Use the invite link [https://discord.gg/zxquHwKy5](https://discord.gg/zxquHwKy5) to join the conference Discord.**

- Follow announcements in the [INTRO/general](https://discord.com/channels/###--general###) channel.
- Meet other fellow researchers and introduce yourself in the [INTRO/random-social](https://discord.com/channels/1112733937828102206/1146806529492787220)
- Ask in the [INTRO/help-me](https://discord.com/channels/###--help-me###) channel.

* **Use Discord instead of the built-in Zoom chat to ask & comment during the oral sessions.** The Zoom chat will not be monitored.
- **If you are presenting a paper, please introduce yourself** in the channel dedicated to the sessions containing your presentation, so others can easily contact you.
- **Discuss virtually presented posters** on Friday September 15 at 9:00am CEST in one of the [VIRTUAL POSTERs category **voice** channels](https://discord.com/channels/###virtualpostersession###).
