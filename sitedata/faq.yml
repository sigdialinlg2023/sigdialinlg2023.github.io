      - Question: Eventbrite asks for a ZIP code but I don't have one.
        Answer: For US bank cards, this is used for fraud detection purposes. For cards outside of the US, the entered value shouldn't make a difference for your payment. You can enter your own postal code in your country, or just "00000", both options have been tested to work.
