    QA:
      - Question: I would like to attend in person, but I am not sure yet if I can travel. What should I tick during the registration?
        Answer: It's best if you tick attendance in person and [let us know by email](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/ondrej-dusek) in case you're not able to travel. We'll update our records and you can present online.
