      abstract: "Playing with large language models can be fun. But what if you really need them? Bring your own laptop, programming skills, and open mind. In a team of 3-5 people, you will have 6 hours to build a system for data-to-text generation."

  "12 September": 

    - session: tamingllm
      UID: TamingLLM
      abbrev: TamingLLM
      title: "Taming Large Language Models: Controllability in the era of Interactive Assistants"

      schedule_url: https://ctrlnlg.github.io/#schedule
      abstract: "The goal of our workshop is to provide a common ground for experts working on different models and tasks related to controllable text generation. The interplay between research on controlled-generation and instruction-based learning paradigms sits at the heart of our discussions. Here, they can share task-agnostic solutions, engage in evaluations, and discuss task-specific challenges. By encouraging communication, collaboration, and research amongst attendees, the workshop intends to foster insightful debates about the recent progress of the NLG community."
