    - sessions: ['practicald2t',]
      abbrev: PracticalD2T
      title: 1st Workshop on Practical LLM-assisted Data-to-Text Generation
      organizers: Zdeněk Kasner
      contact: kasner@ufal.mff.cuni.cz
      url: http://practicald2t.github.io/
      schedule_url: https://practicald2t.github.io/#schedule
      abstract: "Playing with large language models can be fun. But what if you really need them? Bring your own laptop, programming skills, and open mind. In a team of 3-5 people, you will have 6 hours to build a system for data-to-text generation."

  "12 September": 

    - sessions: ['tamingllm', ]
      abbrev: TamingLLM
      title: "Taming Large Language Models: Controllability in the era of Interactive Assistants"
      organizers: Robert Xiangru Tang
      contact: xiangru.tang@yale.edu
      url: https://ctrlnlg.github.io/
      schedule_url: https://ctrlnlg.github.io/#schedule
      abstract: "The goal of our workshop is to provide a common ground for experts working on different models and tasks related to controllable text generation. The interplay between research on controlled-generation and instruction-based learning paradigms sits at the heart of our discussions. Here, they can share task-agnostic solutions, engage in evaluations, and discuss task-specific challenges. By encouraging communication, collaboration, and research amongst attendees, the workshop intends to foster insightful debates about the recent progress of the NLG community."

    - sessions: ['mmnlg', ]
      abbrev: MMNLG
      title: Workshop on Multimodal, Multilingual Natural Language Generation and Multilingual WebNLG Challenge
      organizers: Albert Gatt
      contact: a.gatt@uu.nl
      url: https://synalp.gitlabpages.inria.fr/mmnlg2023/
      schedule_url: https://synalp.gitlabpages.inria.fr/mmnlg2023/schedule/
      abstract: "This event aims to bring together researchers working on text generation from multimodal input data. The workshop also emphasises multilinguality as an ongoing, open challenge for text generation methods, especially for languages which are relatively under-resourced."

    - sessions: ['icard', ]
      abbrev: ICARD
      title: Connecting multiple disciplines to AI techniques in interaction-centric autism research and diagnosis
