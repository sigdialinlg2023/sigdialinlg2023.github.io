    title: "NLG for Human-Robot Interaction: Challenges and Opportunities"
    institution: Edinburgh Napier University
    name: Dimitra Gkatzia
    abstract: "Human-robot interaction (HRI) focuses on researching the interaction between humans and (mostly) physical robots. Despite the media coverage of robots displaying human-level capabilities in conversational dialogue and NLG, in reality, such robots use simple template-based approaches and follow pre-scripted interactions. In this talk, I will initially provide an overview of current approaches to NLG for HRI focusing on the limitations of current approaches and emphasising the challenges of developing flexible NLG approaches for HRI. Finally, I will provide an overview of our project [CiViL: Commonsense and Visually-enhanced natural Language generation](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/T014598/1) and discuss future directions."
    bio: "Dimitra Gkatzia is an Associate Professor at the School of Computing at Edinburgh Napier University and a SICSA AI Theme co-lead. Dimitra is interested in making computers and robots interact in a human-like way using natural language, while at the same time respecting the privacy of the users. Her current work on Human-Robot Interaction focuses on the interplay between various modalities (vision, speech, knowledge-bases) in real-world settings for human-robot teaming scenarios. Her work in this area focuses on enhancing computers/robots' conversational capabilities with 'commensense' similar to the ones present in human-human communication. She is also interested in NLG evaluation practices as well as addressing the challenges of NLG in low-resource settings where example relevant tools are scarce and data is not freely available, or it is hard to acquire due to challenges such as privacy issues or low numbers of native speakers of a language."

    title: "From Generating Personalised Risk Descriptions to Data-driven Health Narratives: Applying NLG to Healthcare Data"
    institution: Tilburg University
    name: Emiel Krahmer
    abstract: TBD
    bio: "Prof. Dr. Emiel Krahmer is a full professor in the Tilburg School of Humanities and Digital Sciences. In his research, he studies how people communicate with each other, and how computers can be taught to communicate in a similar fashion, to improve communication between humans and machines. His current research is positioned at the intersection of artificial intelligence, natural language processing and human communication studies, and has applications in, for example, media (e.g., automatic moderation and summarization of online discussions), health (e.g., data-driven treatment decision aids; chatbots for smoking cessation) and education (e.g., social robots teaching children a second language)."
