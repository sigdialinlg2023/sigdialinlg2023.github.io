    title: "Engaging the Patient in Healthcare: Summarization and Interaction"
    institution: University of Illinois Chicago
    #full_video:
    name: Barbara Di Eugenio
    abstract: "Effective and compassionate communication with patients is becoming central to healthcare. I will discuss the results of and lessons learned from three ongoing projects in this space. The first, MyPHA, aims to provide patients with a clear and understandable summary of their hospital stay, which is informed by doctors’ and nurses’ perspectives, and by the strengths and concerns of the patients themselves. The second, SMART-SMS, models health coaching interactions via text exchanges that encourage patients to adopt specific and realistic physical activity goals. The third, HFChat, envisions an always-on-call conversational assistant for heart failure patients, that they can ask for information about lifestyle issues such as food and exercise. All our work is characterized by: large interdisciplinary groups of investigators who bring different perspectives to the research; grounding computational models in ecologically valid data, which is small by its own nature; the need for culturally valid interventions, since our UI Health system predominantly serves underprivileged, minority populations; and the challenges that arise when dealing with the healthcare enterprise."

    title: "Textless NLP: towards language processing from raw audio"
    institution: Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS)
    #full_video:
    name: Emmanuel Dupoux
    abstract: "The oral (or gestural) modality is the most natural channel for human language interactions. Yet, language technology (Natural Language Processing, NLP) is primarily based on the written modality, and requires massive amounts of textual resources for the training of useful language models. As a result, even fundamentally speech-first applications like speech-to-speech translation or spoken assistants like Alexa, or Siri, are constructed in a Frankenstein way, with text as an intermediate representation between the signal and language models. Besides this being inefficient, This has two unfortunate consequences: first, only a small fraction of the world's languages that have massive textual repositories can be addressed by current technology. Second, even for text-rich languages, the oral form mismatches the written form at a variety of levels, including vocabulary and expressions. The oral medium also contains typically unwritten linguistic features like rhythm and intonation (prosody) and rich paralinguistic information (non verbal vocalizations like laughter, cries, clicks, etc, nuances carried through changes in voice qualities) which are therefore inaccessible to language models. But is this a necessity? Could we build language applications directly from the audio stream without using any text? In this talk, we review recent breakthroughs in representation learning and self-supervised techniques which have made it possible to learn latent linguistic units directly from audio which unlock the learning of generative language models without the use of any text. We show that these models can capture heretofore unaddressed nuances of the oral language including in a dialogue context, opening up the possibility of speech-to-speech textless NLP applications. We outline existing technical challenges to achieve this goal, including challenges to build expressive oral language datasets at scale."

    title: "Knowledge graph use cases in natural language generation"
    institution: King’s College London
    #full_video:
    name: Elena Simperl
    abstract: "Natural language generation (NLG) makes knowledge graphs (KGs) more accessible. I will present two applications of NLG in this space: in the first one, verbalisations of KG triples feed into downstream KG applications, allowing users with diverse levels of digital literacy to share their knowledge, and contribute to the KG. In the second one, having text representations of KG triples helps us verify the content of a KG against external sources towards more trustworthy KGs. I will present human-in-the-loop solutions to these applications that leverage a range of machine learning techniques to scale to the large, multilingual knowledge graphs modern applications use."
    bio: "Elena Simperl is a Professor of Computer Science and Deputy Head of Department for Enterprise and Engagement in the Department of Informatics at King’s College London.

    title: "Aligning ChatGPT: past, present, and future"
    institution: OpenAI
    #full_video:
    name: Ryan Lowe
    abstract: "In this talk I will present different perspectives on the alignment of chatbots like ChatGPT. I’ll review reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), the core training technique behind InstructGPT and ChatGPT, including a brief history of how it was developed. I’ll discuss some of the pitfalls of RLHF, and what is being done today to address them. I’ll then speculate on some of the alignment challenges I expect we’ll face with this new generation of powerful personal assistants, how they could reshape society, and some things we’ll need to do to make sure these changes are good for humans."
    bio: "Ryan is a researcher at OpenAI on the Alignment team. His most recent work involved proving out RLHF on language models, starting with summarization, then moving to InstructGPT and most recently ChatGPT and GPT-4. Previously, he worked on multi-agent RL, emergent communication, and dialogue systems at McGill University."
