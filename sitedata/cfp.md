We invite the submission of long and short papers, as well as system demonstrations, related to all aspects of Natural Language Generation (NLG), including data-to-text, concept-to-text, text-to-text and vision-to-text approaches. Accepted papers will be presented as oral talks or posters.

The event is organised under the auspices of the Special Interest Group on Natural Language Generation (SIGGEN) (https://aclweb.org/aclwiki/SIGGEN) of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) (https://aclweb.org/).

###Submissions & Format

Three kinds of papers can be submitted:

* Long papers are most appropriate for presenting substantial research results and must not exceed eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited pages of references. The final versions of long papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account.
* Short papers are more appropriate for presenting an ongoing research effort and must not exceed four (4) pages, plus unlimited pages of references. The final versions of short papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 5 pages) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account.
* Demo papers should be no more than two (2) pages in length, including references, and should describe implemented systems which are of relevance to the NLG community. Authors of demo papers should be willing to present a demo of their system during INLG 2021.

Submissions of long and short papers should be made through [ACL Rolling Review](https://aclrollingreview.org). Please refer to the ARR [call for papers](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp) for style files and guidelines. The last ARR submission date for eligibility for INLG 2022 will be the March 15, 2022 deadline. The last date for \"committing\" papers + reviews to INLG will be May 7, 2022 11:59:59 AOE. Authors will \"commit\" papers to INLG 2022 through the INLG 2022 OpenReview commitment site [https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/INLG/2022/Conference_Commitments](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/INLG/2022/Conference_Commitments).

Submissions of demo papers should be made directly through the INLG 2022 OpenReview demo submissions site no later than May 7, 2022: [https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/INLG/2022/Conference](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/INLG/2022/Conference).

All accepted papers will be published in the INLG 2022 proceedings and included in the ACL anthology. A paper accepted for presentation at INLG 2022 must not have been presented at any other meeting with publicly available proceedings. Dual submission to other conferences is permitted, provided that authors clearly indicate this in the submission form. If the paper is accepted at both venues, the authors will need to choose which venue to present at, since they can not present the same paper twice.


### Frequently Asked Questions


Q: What papers may be committed to INLG 2022?<br/>
A: You may commit any paper submitted to ARR since ARR started.

Q: What version of my paper should I commit to INLG 2022?<br/>
A: You must commit the most recent version of the paper that has recevied reviews.

Q: Does INLG 2022 have an anonymity policy?<br/>
A: INLG 2022 follows the [ACL policy](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Policies_for_Submission,_Review_and_Citation).

Q: Can I respond to the reviews when I commit to INLG 2022?<br/>
A: INLG 2022 follows the practice adopted by ACL 2022. In the commitment form there will be space for you to provide an optional comment to the INLG 2022 area chairs. As with ACL 2022, "These comments are mainly to raise potential concerns about objective misunderstandings by the reviewers and/or by the Action Editor about the technical aspect of the paper". These comments will only be visible to the INLG 2022 area chairs and program chairs. They will *not* be shared with the ARR reviewers or action editor. 

Q: Can I revise my paper that I am committing to INLG 2022?<br/>
A: The acceptance decisions will be made on the basis of the most recent version of your paper that was submitted to ARR and received reviews. If your paper is accepted to INLG 2022, you will have the opportunity to revise it before sending the camera-ready version.
