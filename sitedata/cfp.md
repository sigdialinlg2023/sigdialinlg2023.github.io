**SIGDIAL** provides a regular forum for the presentation of cutting-edge research in discourse and dialogue to both academic and industry researchers. Continuing a series of 23 successful previous meetings, this conference spans the research interest areas of discourse and dialogue. The conference is sponsored by the SIGdial organization, which serves as the Special Interest Group on discourse and dialogue for both ACL and ISCA.

**INLG** is a yearly venue for presentations related to all aspects of Natural Language Generation (NLG), including data-to-text, concept-to-text, text-to-text and vision-to-text approaches. The event is organized under the auspices of SIGGEN, the Special Interest Group on Natural Language Generation of ACL.

The joint conference on Sep 13-15 will feature 4 keynote speeches by Barbara Di Eugenio, Emmanuel Dupoux, Elena Simperl and Ryan Lowe, as well as a number of regular paper presentations and system demonstrations.
