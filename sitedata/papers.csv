inlg,124,inlg124,enunlg: a Python library for reproducible neural data-to-text experimentation,David M. Howcroft|Dimitra Gkatzia,0,genchalpostersession+demos,"Over the past decade, a variety of neural architectures for data-to-text generation (NLG) have been proposed. However, each system typically has its own approach to pre- and post-processing and other implementation details. Diversity in implementations is desirable, but it also confounds attempts to compare model performance: are the differences due to the proposed architectures or are they a byproduct of the libraries used or a result of pre- and post-processing decisions made? To improve reproducibility, we re-implement several pre-Transformer neural models for data-to-text NLG within a single framework to facilitate direct comparisons of the models themselves and better understand the contributions of other design choices. We release our library at https://github.com/NapierNLP/enunlg to serve as a baseline for ongoing work in this area including research on NLG for low-resource languages where transformers might not be optimal.",static/papers/inlg/124_Paper.pdf,,,

We introduce a live audio commentator system designed specifically for a racing game, driven by the high demand in the e-sports field. While a player is playing a racing game, our system tracks real-time user play data including speed and steer rotations, and generates commentary to accompany the live stream. Human evaluation suggested that generated commentary enhances enjoyment and understanding of races compared to streams without commentary. Incorporating additional modules to improve diversity and detect irregular events, such as course-outs and collisions, further increases the preference for the output commentaries.",static/papers/inlg/126_Paper.pdf,,,
inlg,9,inlg9,Guided Beam Search to Improve Generalization in Low-Resource Data-to-Text Generation,Nicolas Garneau|Luc Lamontagne,0,inlgoralsession2,"In this paper, we introduce a new beam search algorithm that improves the generalization of neural generators to unseen examples, especially in low-resource data-to-text settings. Our algorithm aims to reduce the number of omissions and hallucinations during the decoding process. For this purpose, it relies on two regression models to explicitly characterize factual errors. We explain how to create a new dataset to train these models given an original training set of less than a thousand data points. We apply our approach in the low-resource, legal setting using the French Plum2Text dataset, as well as in English using WebNLG. We observe in our experiment that this combination improves the faithfulness of pre-trained neural text generators using both human and automatic evaluation. Moreover, our approach offers a level of interpretability by predicting the number of omissions and hallucinations present in a given generation with respect to the input data. Finally, we visualize our algorithm's exploration of the hypothesis space at different steps during the decoding process.",static/papers/inlg/9_Paper.pdf,,static/posters/INLG2023/9.pdf,
inlg,10,inlg10,XF2T: Cross-lingual Fact-to-Text Generation for Low-Resource Languages,Shivprasad Sagare|Tushar Abhishek|Bhavyajeet Singh|Anubhav Sharma|Manish Gupta|Vasudeva Varma,0,inlgoralsession2,"Multiple business scenarios require an automated generation of descriptive human-readable text from structured input data. This has resulted into substantial work on fact-to-text generation systems recently. Unfortunately, previous work on fact-to-text (F2T) generation has focused primarily on English mainly due to the high availability of relevant datasets. Only recently, the problem of cross-lingual fact-to-text (XF2T) was proposed for generation across multiple languages alongwith a dataset, XAlign for eight languages. However, there has been no rigorous work on the actual XF2T generation problem. We extend XAlign dataset with annotated data for four more languages: Punjabi, Malayalam, Assamese and Oriya. We conduct an extensive study using popular Transformer-based text generation models on our extended multi-lingual dataset, which we call XAlignV2. Further, we investigate the performance of different text generation strategies: multiple variations of pretraining, fact-aware embeddings and structure-aware input encoding. Our extensive experiments show that a multi-lingual mT5 model which uses fact-aware embeddings with structure-aware input encoding leads to best results (30.90 BLEU, 55.12 METEOR and 59.17 chrF++) across the twelve languages. We make our code, dataset and model publicly available, and hope that this will help advance further research in this critical area.",static/papers/inlg/10_Paper.pdf,,,
inlg,12,inlg12,Preventing Generation of Verbatim Memorization in Language Models Gives a False Sense of Privacy,Daphne Ippolito|Florian Tramer|Milad Nasr|Chiyuan Zhang|Matthew Jagielski|Katherine Lee|Christopher Choquette Choo|Nicholas Carlini,0,inlgoralsession1,"Studying data memorization in neural language models helps us understand the risks (e.g., to privacy or copyright) associated with models regurgitating training data and aids in the development of countermeasures. Many prior works---and some recently deployed defenses---focus on ``verbatim memorization'', defined as a model generation that exactly matches a substring from the training set. We argue that verbatim memorization definitions are too restrictive and fail to capture more subtle forms of memorization. Specifically, we design and implement an efficient defense that _perfectly_ prevents all verbatim memorization.  And yet, we demonstrate that this ``perfect'' filter does not prevent the leakage of training data. Indeed, it is easily circumvented by plausible and minimally modified ``style-transfer'' prompts---and in some cases even the non-modified original prompts---to extract memorized information. We conclude by discussing potential alternative definitions and why defining memorization is a difficult yet crucial open question for neural language models.",static/papers/inlg/12_Paper.pdf,,,
inlg,15,inlg15,Fine-Tuning GPT-3 for Synthetic Danish News Generation,Mina Almasi|Anton Schiønning,0,inlgoralsession3,"While GPT-3 has garnered significant attention for its capabilities in natural language generation, research on its use outside of English is still relatively limited. We focus on how GPT-3 can be fine-tuned for generating synthetic news articles in a low-resource language, namely Danish. The model's performance is evaluated on the dimensions of human and machine detection in two separate experiments. When presented with either a real or GPT-3 generated news article, human participants achieve a 58.1% classification accuracy. Contrarily, a fine-tuned BERT classifier obtains a 92.7% accuracy on the same task. This discrepancy likely pertains to the fine-tuned GPT-3 model oversampling high-likelihood tokens in its text generation. Although this is undetectable to the human eye, it leaves a statistical discrepancy for machine classifiers to detect. We address how decisions in the experimental design favoured the machine classifiers over the human evaluators, and whether the produced synthetic articles are applicable in a real-world context.",static/papers/inlg/15_Paper.pdf,,static/posters/INLG2023/15.pdf,
inlg,16,inlg16,GAN-LM: Generative Adversarial Network using Language Models for Downstream Applications,Dae Yon Hwang|Yaroslav Nechaev|Cyprien de Lichy|Renxian Zhang,0,inlgoralsession5,"In this work, we investigate Data Augmentation methods to improve the performance of state-of-the-art models for four different downstream tasks. Specifically, we propose Generative Adversarial Network using Language Models (GAN-LM) approach that combines a deep generative model with a pre-trained language model to produce diverse augmentations. We compare the GAN-LM to various conventional methods in non-contextual- and contextual-levels on four public datasets: ZESHEL for zero-shot entity linking, TREC for question classification, STS-B for sentence pairs semantic textual similarity (STS), and mSTS for multilingual sentence pairs STS. Additionally, we subsample these datasets to study the impact of such augmentations in low-resource settings where limited amounts of training data is available. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks, we mostly achieve the best performance using GAN-LM approach. Finally, we investigate the way of combining the GAN-LM with other augmentation methods to complement our proposed approach. The developed code for reproducibility is included in the supplementary material.",static/papers/inlg/16_Paper.pdf,,static/posters/INLG2023/16.pdf,
inlg,24,inlg24,Summaries as Captions: Generating Figure Captions for Scientific Documents with Automated Text Summarization,Chieh-Yang Huang|Ting-Yao Hsu|Ryan Rossi|Ani Nenkova|Sungchul Kim|Gromit Yeuk-Yin Chan|Eunyee Koh|C Lee Giles|Ting-Hao Huang,0,inlgoralsession5,"Good figure captions help paper readers understand complex scientific figures. Unfortunately, even published papers often have poorly written captions. Automatic caption generation could aid paper writers by providing good starting captions that can be refined for better quality. Prior work often treated figure caption generation as a vision-to-language task. In this paper, we show that it can be more effectively tackled as a text summarization task in scientific documents. We fine-tuned PEGASUS, a pre-trained abstractive summarization model, to specifically summarize figure-referencing paragraphs (e.g., ""Figure 3 shows..."") into figure captions. Experiments on large-scale arXiv figures show that our method outperforms prior vision methods in both automatic and human evaluations. We further conducted an in-depth investigation focused on two key challenges: (i) the common presence of low-quality author-written captions and (ii) the lack of clear standards for good captions. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/Crowd-AI-Lab/Generating-Figure-Captions-as-a-Text-Summarization-Task.",static/papers/inlg/24_Paper.pdf,,static/posters/INLG2023/24.pdf,
inlg,30,inlg30,Models of reference production: How do they withstand the test of time?,Fahime Same|Guanyi Chen|Kees van Deemter,0,inlgoralsession4,"In recent years, many NLP studies have focused solely on performance improvement. In this work, we focus on the linguistic and scientific aspects of NLP. We use the task of generating referring expressions in context (REG-in-context) as a case study and start our analysis from GREC, a comprehensive set of shared tasks in English that addressed this topic over a decade ago. We ask what the performance of models would be if we assessed them (1) on more realistic datasets, and (2) using more advanced methods. We test the models using different evaluation metrics and feature selection experiments. We conclude that GREC can no longer be regarded as offering a reliable assessment of models' ability to mimic human reference production, because the results are highly impacted by the choice of corpus and evaluation metrics. Our results also suggest that pre-trained language models are less dependent on the choice of corpus than classic Machine Learning models, and therefore make more robust class predictions.",static/papers/inlg/30_Paper.pdf,,static/posters/INLG2023/30.pdf,
inlg,34,inlg34,Generating Faithful Text From a Knowledge Graph with Noisy Reference Text,Tahsina Hashem|Weiqing Wang|Derry Tanti Wijaya|Mohammed Eunus Ali|Yuan-Fang Li,0,inlgoralsession1,"Knowledge Graph (KG)-to-Text generation aims at generating fluent natural-language text that accurately represents the information of a given knowledge graph. While significant progress has been made in this task by exploiting the power of pre-trained language models (PLMs) with appropriate graph structure-aware modules, existing models still fall short of generating faithful text, especially when the ground-truth natural-language text contains additional information that is not present in the graph. In this paper, we develop a KG-to-text generation model that can generate faithful natural-language text from a given graph, in the presence of noisy reference text. Our framework incorporates two core ideas: Firstly, we utilize contrastive learning to enhance the model's ability to differentiate between faithful and hallucinated information in the text, thereby encouraging the decoder to generate text that aligns with the input graph. Secondly, we empower the decoder to control the level of hallucination in the generated text by employing a controllable text generation technique. We evaluate our model's performance through the standard quantitative metrics as well as a ChatGPT-based quantitative and qualitative analysis. Our evaluation demonstrates the superior performance of our model over state-of-the-art KG-to-text models on faithfulness.",static/papers/inlg/34_Paper.pdf,,,
inlg,44,inlg44,Entropy-based Sampling for Abstractive Multi-document Summarization in Low-resource Settings,Laura Mascarell|Ribin Chalumattu|Julien Heitmann,0,inlgoralsession2,"Research in Multi-document Summarization (MDS) mostly focuses on the English language and depends on large MDS datasets that are not available for other languages. Some of these approaches concatenate the source documents, resulting in overlong model inputs. Existing transformer architectures are unable to process such long inputs entirely, omitting documents in the summarization process. Other solutions address this issue by implementing multi-stage approaches that also require changes in the model architecture. In this paper, we introduce various sampling approaches based on information entropy that allow us to perform MDS in a single stage. These approaches also consider all source documents without using MDS training data nor changing the model's architecture. Besides, we build a MDS test set of German news articles to assess the performance of our methods on abstractive multi-document summaries. Experimental results show that our entropy-based approaches outperform previous state-of-the-art on German MDS, while still remaining primarily abstractive. We release our code and MDS test set to encourage further research in German abstractive MDS.",static/papers/inlg/44_Paper.pdf,,static/posters/INLG2023/44.pdf,
inlg,47,inlg47,Claim Optimization in Computational Argumentation,Gabriella Skitalinskaya|Maximilian Spliethöver|Henning Wachsmuth,0,inlgoralsession5,"An optimal delivery of arguments is key to persuasion in any debate, both for humans and for AI systems. This requires the use of clear and fluent claims relevant to the given debate. Prior work has studied the automatic assessment of argument quality extensively. Yet, no approach actually improves the quality so far. To fill this gap, this paper proposes the task of claim optimization: to rewrite argumentative claims in order to optimize their delivery. As multiple types of optimization are possible, we approach this task by first generating a diverse set of candidate claims using a large language model, such as BART, taking into account contextual information. Then, the best candidate is selected using various quality metrics. In automatic and human evaluation on an English-language corpus, our quality-based candidate selection outperforms several baselines, improving 60% of all claims (worsening 16% only). Follow-up analyses reveal that, beyond copy editing, our approach often specifies claims with details, whereas it adds less evidence than humans do. Moreover, its capabilities generalize well to other domains, such as instructional texts.",static/papers/inlg/47_Paper.pdf,,static/posters/INLG2023/47.pdf,
inlg,56,inlg56,ChatGPT's Information Seeking Strategy: Insights from the 20-Questions Game,Leonardo Bertolazzi|Davide Mazzaccara|Filippo Merlo|Raffaella Bernardi,0,inlgoralsession3,"Large Language Models, and ChatGPT in particular, have recently grabbed the attention of the community and the media. Having reached high language proficiency, attention has been shifting toward its reasoning capabilities. In this paper, our main aim is to evaluate ChatGPT's question generation in a task where language production should be driven by an implicit reasoning process. To this end, we employ the 20-Questions game, traditionally used within the Cognitive Science community to inspect the information seeking-strategy's development.  This task requires a series of interconnected skills: asking informative questions, stepwise updating the hypothesis space, and stopping asking questions when enough information has been collected. We build hierarchical hypothesis spaces, exploiting feature norms collected from humans vs. ChatGPT itself, and we inspect the efficiency and informativeness of ChatGPT's strategy. Our results show that ChatGPT's performance gets closer to an optimal agent only when prompted to explicitly list the updated space stepwise.",static/papers/inlg/56_Paper.pdf,,,
inlg,57,inlg57,This is not correct! Negation-aware Evaluation of Language Generation Systems,Miriam Anschütz|Diego Miguel Lozano|Georg Groh,0,inlgoralsession4,"Large language models underestimate the impact of negations on how much they change the meaning of a sentence. Therefore, learned evaluation metrics based on these models are insensitive to negations. In this paper, we propose NegBLEURT, a negation-aware version of the BLEURT evaluation metric. For that, we designed a rule-based sentence negation tool and used it to create the CANNOT negation evaluation dataset. Based on this dataset, we fine-tuned a sentence transformer and an evaluation metric to improve their negation sensitivity. Evaluating these models on existing benchmarks shows that our fine-tuned models outperform existing metrics on the negated sentences by far while preserving their base models' performances on other perturbations.",static/papers/inlg/57_Paper.pdf,,static/posters/INLG2023/57.pdf,
inlg,58,inlg58,Guidance in Radiology Report Summarization: An Empirical Evaluation and Error Analysis,Jan Trienes|Paul Youssef|Jörg Schlötterer|Christin Seifert,0,inlgoralsession1,"Automatically summarizing radiology reports into a concise impression can reduce the manual burden of clinicians and improve the consistency of reporting. Previous work aimed to enhance content selection and factuality through guided abstractive summarization. However, two key issues persist. First, current methods heavily rely on domain-specific resources to extract the guidance signal, limiting their transferability to domains and languages where those resources are unavailable. Second, while automatic metrics like ROUGE show progress, we lack a good understanding of the errors and failure modes in this task. To bridge these gaps, we first propose a domain-agnostic guidance signal in form of variable-length extractive summaries. Our empirical results on two English benchmarks demonstrate that this guidance signal improves upon unguided summarization while being competitive with domain-specific methods. Additionally, we run an expert evaluation of four systems according to a taxonomy of 11 fine-grained errors. We find that the most pressing differences between automatic summaries and those of radiologists relate to content selection including omissions (up to 52%) and additions (up to 57%). We hypothesize that latent reporting factors and corpus-level inconsistencies may limit models to reliably learn content selection from the available data, presenting promising directions for future work.",static/papers/inlg/58_Paper.pdf,,static/posters/INLG2023/58.pdf,
inlg,71,inlg71,A Zero-Shot Approach for Multi-User Task-Oriented Dialog Generation,Shiv Surya|Yohan Jo|Arijit Biswas|Alexandros Potamianos,0,inlgoralsession5,"Prior art investigating task-oriented dialog and automatic generation of such dialogs have focused on single-user dialogs between a single user and an agent. However, there is limited study on adapting such AI agents to multi-user conversations (involving multiple users and an agent). Multi-user conversations are richer than single-user conversations containing social banter and collaborative decision making. The most significant challenge impeding such studies is the lack of suitable multi-user task-oriented dialogs with annotations of user belief states and system actions. One potential solution is multi-user dialog generation from single-user data. Many single-user dialogs datasets already contain dialog state information (intents, slots), thus making them suitable candidates. In this work, we propose a novel approach for expanding single-user task-oriented dialogs (e.g. MultiWOZ) to multi-user dialogs in a zero-shot setting.",static/papers/inlg/71_Paper.pdf,,,
inlg,83,inlg83,Beyond the Bias: Unveiling the Quality of Implicit Causality Prompt Continuations in Language Models,Judith Sieker|Oliver Bott|Torgrim Solstad|Sina Zarrieß,0,inlgoralsession4,"Recent studies have used human continuations of Implicit Causality (IC) prompts collected in linguistic experiments to evaluate discourse understanding in large language models (LLMs), focusing on the well-known IC coreference bias in the LLMs' predictions of the next word following the prompt. In this study, we investigate how continuations of IC prompts can be used to evaluate the text generation capabilities of LLMs in a linguistically controlled setting. We conduct an experiment using two open-source GPT-based models, employing human evaluation to assess different aspects of continuation quality. Our findings show that LLMs struggle in particular with generating coherent continuations in this rather simple setting, indicating a lack of discourse knowledge beyond the well-known IC bias. Our results also suggest that a bias congruent continuation does not necessarily equate to a higher continuation quality. Furthermore, our study draws upon insights from the Uniform Information Density hypothesis, testing different prompt modifications and decoding procedures and showing that sampling-based methods are particularly sensitive to the information density of the prompts.",static/papers/inlg/83_Paper.pdf,,static/posters/INLG2023/83.pdf,

We propose a solution in the form of data views, where each view describes an entity and its attributes along specific dimensions. A sequence of views can then be used as a high-level schema for document planning, with the neural model handling the complexities of micro-planning and surface realization. We show that our view-based system retains factual accuracy while offering high-level control of output that can be tailored based on user preference or other norms within the domain.",static/papers/inlg/97_Paper.pdf,,static/posters/INLG2023/97.pdf,

We propose a memory-creation pipeline that converts raw text into condensed memories and a memory-retrieval system that utilizes these memories to generate character responses. Using a fact-checking pipeline based on GPT-4, our evaluation demonstrates that the character responses are grounded in the retrieved memories and maintain factual accuracy. We discuss the implications of our system for creating engaging and consistent virtual characters and highlight areas for future research, including large language model (LLM) guardrailing and virtual character personality development.",static/papers/inlg/99_Paper.pdf,,static/posters/INLG2023/99.pdf,
inlg,107,inlg107,Metric-Based In-context Learning: A Case Study in Text Simplification,Subhadra Vadlamannati|Gözde Şahin,0,inlgoralsession3,"In-context learning (ICL) for large language models has proven to be a powerful approach for many natural language processing tasks. However, determining the best method to select examples for ICL is nontrivial as the results can vary greatly depending on the quality, quantity, and order of examples used. In this paper, we conduct a case study on text simplification (TS) to investigate how to select the best and most robust examples for ICL. We propose Metric-Based in-context Learning (MBL) method that utilizes commonly used TS metrics such as SARI, compression ratio, and BERT-Precision for selection. Through an extensive set of experiments with various-sized GPT models on standard TS benchmarks such as TurkCorpus and ASSET, we show that examples selected by the top SARI scores perform the best on larger models such as GPT-175B, while the compression ratio generally performs better on smaller models such as GPT-13B and GPT-6.7B. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MBL is generally robust to example orderings and out-of-domain test sets, and outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art finetuned language models. Finally, we show that the behavior of large GPT models can be implicitly controlled by the chosen metric. Our research provides a new framework for selecting examples in ICL, and demonstrates its effectiveness in text simplification tasks, breaking new ground for more accurate and efficient NLG systems.",static/papers/inlg/107_Paper.pdf,,,
inlg,115,inlg115,Exploring the Naturalness of Cognitive Status-Informed Referring Form Selection Models,Gabriel Del Castillo|Grace Clark|Zhao Han|Tom Williams,0,inlgoralsession4,"Language-capable robots must be able to efficiently and naturally communicate about objects in the environment. A key part of communication is Referring Form Selection (RFS): the process of selecting a form like it, that, or the N to use when referring to an object. Recent cognitive status-informed computational RFS models have been evaluated in terms of goodness-of-fit to human data. But it is as yet unclear whether these models actually select referring forms that are any more natural than baseline alternatives, regardless of goodness-of-fit. Through a human subject study designed to assess this question, we show that even though cognitive status-informed referring selection models achieve good fit to human data, they do not (yet) produce concrete benefits in terms of naturality. On the other hand, our results show that human utterances also had high variability in perceived naturality, demonstrating the challenges of evaluating RFS naturality.",static/papers/inlg/115_Paper.pdf,,static/posters/INLG2023/115.pdf,
inlg,8,inlg8,System-Initiated Transitions from Chit-Chat to Task-Oriented Dialogues with Transition Info Extractor and Transition Sentence Generator,Ye Liu|Stefan Ultes|Wolfgang Minker|Wolfgang Maier,0,inlgpostersession+flash,"In this work, we study dialogue scenarios that start from chit-chat but eventually switch to task-related services, and investigate how a unified dialogue model, which can engage in both chit-chat and task-oriented dialogues, takes the initiative during the dialogue mode transition from chit-chat to task-oriented in a coherent and cooperative manner. We firstly build a \emph{transition info extractor} (TIE) that keeps track of the preceding chit-chat interaction and detects the potential user intention to switch to a task-oriented service. Meanwhile, in the unified model, a \emph{transition sentence generator} (TSG) is extended through efficient Adapter tuning and transition prompt learning. When the TIE successfully finds task-related information from the preceding chit-chat, such as a transition domain (``train'' in Figure \ref{fig: system-initiated transition from chit-chat to task-oriented.}), then the TSG is activated automatically in the unified model to initiate this transition by generating a transition sentence under the guidance of transition information extracted by TIE. The experimental results show promising performance regarding the proactive transitions. We achieve an additional large improvement on TIE model by utilizing Conditional Random Fields (CRF). The TSG can flexibly generate transition sentences while maintaining the unified capabilities of normal chit-chat and task-oriented response generation.",static/papers/inlg/8_Paper.pdf,,static/posters/INLG2023/8.pdf,
inlg,13,inlg13,"HL Dataset: Visually-grounded Description of Scenes, Actions and Rationales",Michele Cafagna|Kees van Deemter|Albert Gatt,0,inlgpostersession+flash,"Current captioning datasets focus on object-centric captions, describing the visible objects in the image, often ending up stating the obvious (for humans), e.g. ""people eating food in a park"". Although these datasets are useful to evaluate the ability of Vision & Language models to recognize and describe visual content, they do not support controlled experiments involving model testing or fine-tuning, with more high-level captions, which humans find easy and natural to produce. For example, people often describe images based on the type of scene they depict (""people at a holiday resort"") and the actions they perform (""people having a picnic""). Such concepts are based on personal experience and contribute to forming common sense assumptions. We present the High-Level Dataset, a dataset extending 14997 images from the COCO dataset, aligned with a new set of 134,973 human-annotated (high-level) captions collected along three axes: scenes, actions and rationales. We further extend this dataset with confidence scores collected from an independent set of readers, as well as a set of narrative captions generated synthetically, by combining each of the three axes.

inlg,25,inlg25,Validating Predictive Models Of Evaluative Language For Controllable Data2Text Generation,Maurice Langner|Ralf Klabunde,0,virtualpostersession,"In data2text generation, tabular data is transformed into a text that expresses information from that source domain. While some text types, such as instructions, demand objective and neutral language without any expressive and evaluative content, many other text types are expected to provide expressions for these kinds of subjective meanings.  In controllable, pipelined neural NLG separate learning models, notably regression models, can be used to predict whether some feature deviates sufficiently strongly from an expected value, so that evaluative language would be appropriate for verbalizing this finding. In this paper, we present an empirical study on the comprehension of evaluative adverbs and adjectival modifiers in car reviews, a text type that is characterized by a mixture of factual information with evaluations expressing positive or negative surprise. We show to what extend regression-based decision boundaries for producing evaluative content in controllable data2text NLG match the reader's expectations that are raised by those evaluative markers. Finally we show that regression values in combination with standard deviation of the technical input data constitute reasonable Boolean thresholds for both positive and negative surprise, which provide the basis for the development of more complex models that also include the scalar base of adverbs and modifiers.",static/papers/inlg/25_Paper.pdf,,static/posters/INLG2023/25.pdf,

The application of prompt-based learning with large language models (LLMs), exemplified by GPT-3, has exhibited remarkable performance in diverse natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This paper conducts a comprehensive investigation, utilizing both automatic and human evaluation, to compare the story generation capacity of LLMs with recent models across three  datasets with variations in style, register, and length of stories. The results demonstrate that LLMs generate stories of significantly higher quality compared to other story generation models. Moreover, they exhibit a level of performance that competes with human authors, albeit with the preliminary observation that they tend to replicate real stories in situations involving world knowledge, resembling a form of plagiarism.",static/papers/inlg/27_Paper.pdf,,static/posters/INLG2023/27.pdf,

We follow a similar transduction method, in which we transpose the more difficult direct source to target TST task to a simpler Style-Masked Language Model (SMLM) Task, wherein, similar to BERT \cite{bert}, the goal of our model is now to reconstruct the source sentence from its style-masked version. We arrive at the SMLM mechanism naturally by formulating prototype editing/ transduction methods in a probabilistic framework, where TST resolves into estimating a hypothetical parallel dataset from a partially observed parallel dataset, wherein each domain is assumed to have a common latent style-masked prior. To generate this style-masked prior, we use ""Explainable Attention"" as our choice of attribution for a more precise style-masking step and also introduce a cost-effective and accurate ""Attribution-Surplus"" method of determining the position of masks from any arbitrary attribution model in O(1) time. We empirically show that this non-generational approach well suites the ""content preserving"" criteria for a task like TST, even for a complex style like Discourse Manipulation. Our model, the Style MLM, outperforms strong TST baselines and is on par with state-of-the-art TST models, which use complex architectures and orders of more parameters.",static/papers/inlg/50_Paper.pdf,,static/posters/INLG2023/50.pdf,

This is appropriate when the goal is to create explicit emotion statements (""The kid is happy.''). Emotions are, however, commonly communicated implicitly. For instance, the emotional interpretation of an event (""Their dog died.'') does often not require an explicit emotion statement. In psychology, appraisal theories explain the link between a cognitive evaluation of an event and the potentially developed emotion. They put the assessment of the situation on the spot, for instance regarding the own control or the responsibility for what happens. We hypothesize and subsequently show that including appraisal variables as conditions in a generation framework comes with two advantages. (1) The generation model is informed in greater detail about what makes a specific emotion and what properties it has. This leads to text generation that better fulfills the condition. (2) The variables of appraisal allow a user to perform a more fine-grained control of the generated text, by stating properties of a situation instead of only providing the emotion category.  Our Bart and T5-based experiments with 7 emotions (Anger, Disgust, Fear, Guilt, Joy, Sadness, Shame), and 7 appraisals (Attention, Responsibility, Control, Circumstance, Pleasantness, Effort, Certainty) show that (1) adding appraisals during training improves the accurateness of the generated texts by 10 pp in F1. Further, (2) the texts with appraisal variables are longer and contain more details. This exemplifies the greater control for users.",static/papers/inlg/121_Paper.pdf,,,

Previous studies proposed specifying the keywords that should be included in the generated text. However, this approach is insufficient to generate text that reflect the user's intent.

In this paper, we tackle a novel task of controlling not only keywords but also the position of each keyword in the text generation. To this end, we propose a task-independent method that uses special tokens to control the relative position of keywords.

In this work, we curate a large-scale dialogue dataset that contains ≈1.3M peer support dialogues spanning across more than 4K distress-related topics. We analyze the empathetic characteristics of this dataset using statistical and visual means. To demonstrate the utility of this dataset, we train four baseline neural dialogue models that can respond empathetically to distress prompts. Two of the baselines adapt existing architecture and the other two incorporate a framework identifying levels of cognitive and emotional empathy in responses. Automatic and human evaluation of these models validate the utility of the dataset in generating empathetic responses for distress support and show that identifying levels of empathy in peer-support responses facilitates generating responses that are lengthier, richer in empathy, and closer to the ground truth.</p>",static/papers/sigdial/27_Paper.pdf,,,

We enhance ChatGPT's ability to reason for the system's perspective by integrating in-context learning with commonsense knowledge.

People share goals, answer each other's goals, and provide other people's goals in MPCs - none of which occur in dyadic interactions. To understand user goals in MPCs, we compared three methods in zero-shot and few-shot settings: we fine-tuned T5, created pre-training tasks to train DialogLM using LED, and employed prompt engineering techniques with GPT-3.5-turbo, to determine which approach can complete this novel task with limited data. GPT-3.5-turbo significantly outperformed the others in a few-shot setting. The 'reasoning' style prompt, when given 7% of the corpus as example annotated conversations, was the best performing method. It correctly annotated 62.32% of the goal tracking MPCs, and 69.57% of the intent-slot recognition MPCs.

However, such subjective impressions (e.g., how much the user enjoys the dialogue) are inherently ambiguous, and the annotation results provided by multiple annotators do not always agree because they depend on the subjectivity of the annotators. In this paper, we analyzed the annotation results using 13,226 exchanges from 155 participants in a multimodal dialogue corpus called Hazumi that we had constructed, where each exchange was annotated by five third-party annotators. We investigated the agreement between the subjective annotations given by the third-party annotators and the participants themselves, on both per-exchange annotations (i.e., participant's sentiments) and per-dialogue (-participant) annotations (i.e., questionnaires on rapport and personality traits). We also investigated the conditions under which the annotation results are reliable.

To address this issue, we propose fine-tuning a causal large language model (LLM) to generate definite descriptions that summarize coreferential information found in the linguistic context of references. We then use a pretrained VLM to identify referents based on the generated descriptions, zero-shot.

Braude|Catherine Lai,7,sigdialpostersession2,"Matching the personality of conversational agent to the personality of the user can significantly improve the user experience, with many successful examples in text-based chatbots. It is also important for a voice-based system to be able to alter the personality of the speech as perceived by the users. In this pilot study, fifteen voices were rated using Big Five personality traits. Five content-neutral sentences were chosen for the listening tests. The audio data, together with two rated traits (Extroversion and Agreeableness), were used to train a neural speech synthesiser based on one male and one female voices. The effect of altering the personality trait features was evaluated by a second listening test. Both perceived extroversion and agreeableness in the synthetic voices were affected significantly. The controllable range was limited due to a lack of variance in the source audio data. The perceived personality traits correlated with each other and with the naturalness of the speech. Future work can be making a chatbot speak in a voice with a pre-defined or adaptive personality by using personality synthesis in speech together with text-based personality generation.</p>",static/papers/sigdial/146_Paper.pdf,,,
sigdial,59,sigdial59,No that's not what I meant: Handling Third Position Repair in Conversational Question Answering,Vevake Balaraman|Arash Eshghi|Ioannis Konstas|Ioannis Papaioannou,8,virtualpostersession,"The ability to handle miscommunication is crucial to robust and faithful conversational AI. People usually deal with miscommunication immediately as they detect it, using highly systematic interactional mechanisms called repair. One important type of repair is Third Position Repair (TPR) whereby a speaker is initially misunderstood but then corrects the misunderstanding as it becomes apparent after the addressee's erroneous response. Here, we collect and publicly release REPAIR-QA, the first large dataset of TPRs in a conversational question answering (QA) setting. The data is comprised of the TPR turns, corresponding dialogue contexts, and candidate repairs of the original turn for execution of TPRs. We demonstrate the usefulness of the data by training and evaluating strong baseline models for executing TPRs. For stand-alone TPR execution, we perform both automatic and human evaluations on a fine-tuned T5 model, as well as OpenAI's GPT-3 LLMs. Additionally, we extrinsically evaluate the LLMs' TPR processing capabilities in the downstream conversational QA task. The results indicate poor out-of-the-box performance on TPR's by the GPT-3 models, which then significantly improves when exposed to REPAIR-QA.</p>",static/papers/sigdial/59_Paper.pdf,,,
sigdial,61,sigdial61,Question Generation to Elicit Users' Food Preferences by Considering the Semantic Content,Jie Zeng|Yukiko Nakano|Tatsuya Sakato,8,sigdialpostersession1,"To obtain a better understanding of user preferences in providing tailored services, dialogue systems have to generate semi-structured interviews that require flexible dialogue control while following a topic guide to accomplish the purpose of the interview. Toward this goal, this study proposes a semantics-aware GPT-3 fine-tuning model that generates interviews to acquire users' food preferences.  The model was trained using dialogue history and semantic representation constructed from the communicative function and semantic content of the utterance. Using two baseline models: zero-shot ChatGPT and fine-tuned GPT-3, we conducted a user study for subjective evaluations alongside automatic objective evaluations. In the user study, in impression rating, the outputs of the proposed model were superior to those of baseline models and comparable to real human interviews in terms of eliciting the interviewees' food preferences.</p>",static/papers/sigdial/61_Paper.pdf,,,

This work enables the TOD systems with more flexibility through a simple cache. The cache provides the flexibility to dynamically update the TOD systems and handle both existing and unseen dialogue scenarios.  Towards this end, we first fine-tune a retrieval module to effectively retrieve the most relevant information entries from the cache. We then train end-to-end TOD models that can refer to and ground on both dialogue history and retrieved information during TOD generation. The introduced cache is straightforward to construct, and the backbone models of TOD systems are compatible with existing pre-trained generative models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our framework, with a notable improvement in non-empty joint goal accuracy by 6.7% compared to strong baselines.</p>",static/papers/sigdial/138_Paper.pdf,,,

This paper explores different strategies, namely prompting, retrieval, and fine-tuning, for task-oriented dialogue generation. Through a systematic evaluation, we aim to provide valuable insights and guidelines for researchers and practitioners working on developing efficient and effective dialogue systems for real-world applications.  Evaluation is performed on the MultiWOZ and Taskmaster-2 datasets, and we test various versions of FLAN-T5, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 models. Costs associated with running these models are analyzed, and dialogue evaluation is briefly discussed. Our findings suggest that when testing data differs from the training data, fine-tuning may decrease performance, favoring a combination of a more general language model and a prompting mechanism based on retrieved examples.</p>",static/papers/sigdial/121_Paper.pdf,,static/posters/SIGDIAL2023/121.pdf,

We explore the construction of safer conversational systems for guiding patients in preparing for colonoscopies.  This has required a data generation pipeline to generate a minimum viable dataset to bootstrap a semantic parser, augmented by automatic paraphrasing.  Our study suggests large language models  (e.g., GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) are a viable alternative to crowd sourced paraphrasing, but conversational systems that rely upon language models' ability to do temporal reasoning struggle to provide accurate responses.  A neural-symbolic system that performs temporal reasoning on an intermediate representation of user queries shows promising results compared to an end-to-end dialogue system, improving the number of correct responses while vastly reducing the number of incorrect or misleading ones.</p>",static/papers/sigdial/132_Paper.pdf,,,
sigdial,155,sigdial155,Applying Item Response Theory to Task-oriented Dialogue Systems for Accurately Determining User's Task Success Ability,Ryu Hirai|Ao Guo|Ryuichiro Higashinaka,11,sigdialpostersession2,"While task-oriented dialogue systems have improved, not all users can fully accomplish their tasks. Users with limited knowledge about the system may experience dialogue breakdowns or fail to achieve their tasks because they do not know how to interact with the system. For addressing this issue, it would be desirable to construct a system that can estimate the user's task success ability and adapt to that ability. In this study, we propose a method that estimates this ability by applying item response theory (IRT), commonly used in education for estimating examinee abilities, to task-oriented dialogue systems. Through experiments predicting the probability of a correct answer to each slot by using the estimated task success ability, we found that the proposed method significantly outperformed baselines.</p>",static/papers/sigdial/155_Paper.pdf,,static/posters/SIGDIAL2023/155.pdf,
sigdial,147,sigdial147,When to generate hedge in peer tutoring interaction?,Alafate Abulimiti|Chloé Clavel|Justine Cassell,3,virtualpostersession,"This paper explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict where hedging occurs in peer-tutoring interactions. The study uses a naturalistic face-to-face dataset annotated for natural language turns, conversational strategies, tutoring strategies, and nonverbal behaviors. These elements are processed into a vector representation of the previous turns, which serves as input to several machine learning models, including MLP and LSTM. The results show that embedding layers, capturing the semantic information of the previous turns, significantly improves the model's performance. Additionally, the study provides insights into the importance of various features, such as interpersonal rapport and nonverbal behaviors, in predicting hedges by using Shapley values for feature explanation. We discover that the eye gaze of both the tutor and the tutee has a significant impact on hedge prediction. We further validate this observation through a follow-up ablation study.</p>",static/papers/sigdial/147_Paper.pdf,,,
