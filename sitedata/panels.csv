Likely topics to be discussed include:

* Ethics in industry versus academia
* Documentation of data and models
* Non-western ethics traditions
* Science communication/dissemination
* Involving users/communities in developing tools and resources

              Margaret Mitchell is a researcher working on Ethical AI, currently focused on the ins and outs of ethics-informed AI development in tech. She has published over 50 papers on natural language generation, assistive technology, computer vision, and AI ethics, and holds multiple patents in the areas of conversation generation and sentiment classification. She previously worked at Google AI as a Staff Research Scientist, where she founded and co-led Google's Ethical AI group, focused on foundational AI ethics research and operationalizing AI ethics Google-internally. Before joining Google, she was a researcher at Microsoft Research, focused on computer vision-to-language generation; and was a postdoc at Johns Hopkins, focused on Bayesian modeling and information extraction. She holds a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Aberdeen and a Master's in computational linguistics from the University of Washington. While earning her degrees, she also worked from 2005-2012 on machine learning, neurological disorders, and assistive technology at Oregon Health and Science University. She has spearheaded a number of workshops and initiatives at the intersections of diversity, inclusion, computer science, and ethics. Her work has received awards from Secretary of Defense Ash Carter and the American Foundation for the Blind, and has been implemented by multiple technology companies. She likes gardening, dogs, and cats.

              Nava Tintarev is a Full Professor of Explainable Artificial Intelligence at the University of Maastricht, and a visiting professor at TU Delft. She leads or contributes to several projects in the field of human-computer interaction in artificial advice-giving systems, such as recommender systems; specifically developing the state-of-the-art automatically generated explanations (transparency) and explanation interfaces (recourse and control). She participates in a Marie-Curie Training Network on Natural Language for Explainable AI (October 2019-October 2023. Currently, she is representing Maastricht university as a Co-Investigator in the ROBUST consortium, pre-selected for a national (NWO) grant with a total budget of 95M (25M from NWO) to carry out long term (10-years) research into trustworthy artificial intelligence. Prior, she was awarded several smaller grants and prizes at TU Delft to support her work on viewpoint diversity (e.g., DDFV seed funding, Mekel Prize).  She regularly shapes international scientific research programs (e.g., on steering committees of journals, or as program chair of conferences), and actively organizes and contributes to strategy workshops relating to responsible data science, both in the Netherlands and internationally.
