Instructions for Presenters
---------------------------

**Oral presentations** are 20 minutes (15 minutes talk and 5 minutes questions).

**Remote oral presentations** are going to be live and follow the same format as in-person presentations.

The **poster size** is A0 vertical.

The virtual demo/poster presenters will have a **Discord voice channel**. Each paper  will have its own channel for video-chatting with other attendees where the presenters can share their screen. The presenters can choose to prepare a poster, slides, or show their demo system.

In-person poster presenters are also **invited to participate in the virtual poster session** for the remote attendees.

Instructions for the virtual posters and remote presenters will be added shortly. If you have questions on remote presentations, please contact *ondrej.platek@gmail.com*.
