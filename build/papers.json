[{"UID":"paper7","abstract":"Text style transfer aims to change the style (e.g., sentiment, politeness) of a sentence while preserving its content. A common solution is the prototype editing approach, where stylistic tokens are deleted in the \u201cmask\u201d stage and then the masked sentences are infilled with the target style tokens in the \u201cinfill\u201d stage. Despite their success, these approaches still suffer from the content preservation problem. By closely inspecting the results of existing approaches, we identify two common types of errors: 1) many content-related tokens are masked and 2) irrelevant words associated with the target style are infilled. Our paper aims to enhance content preservation by tackling each of them. In the \u201cmask\u201d stage, we utilize a BERT-based keyword extraction model that incorporates syntactic information to prevent content-related tokens from being masked. In the \u201cinfill\u201d stage, we create a pseudo-parallel dataset and train a T5 model to infill the masked sentences without introducing irrelevant content. Empirical results show that our method outperforms the state-of-theart baselines in terms of content preservation, while maintaining comparable transfer effectiveness and language quality.","authors":["Wanzheng Zhu","Suma Bhat"],"code":"static/paperfiles/paper7_code.zip","discord":"https://discordapp.com/channels/991043733573218384/994325254329618563","full_video":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/728950843","paper":"static/paperfiles/paper7_paper.pdf","session":"Oral Session 3","slides":"static/paperfiles/paper7_slides.pdf","start_time":"2022-07-21T15:00:00Z","time":"Thursday 07/21 15:00 EST","title":"'Slow Service' $\\Cancel{\\Rightarrow}$ 'Great Food': Enhancing Content Preservation In Unsupervised Text Style Transfer"},{"UID":"paper45","abstract":"We describe our multi-task learning based approach for summarization of real-life dialogues as part of the DialogSum Challenge shared task at INLG 2022.

We aim to study if it is possible to build an amortized noisy channel NMT model such that when we do greedy decoding during inference, the translation accuracy matches that of BSR in terms of reward (based on the source-to-target log probability and the target-to-source log probability) and quality (based on BLEU and BLEURT). We attempt three approaches to train the new model: knowledge distillation, 1- step-deviation imitation learning, and Q learning. The first approach obtains the noisy channel signal from a pseudo-corpus, and the latter two approaches aim to optimize toward a noisy-channel MT reward directly. For all three approaches, the generated translations fail to achieve rewards comparable to BSR, but the translation quality approximated by BLEU and BLEURT is similar to the quality of BSRproduced translations.

Our ELITR Minuting Corpus has been recently accepted to LREC 2022 and publicly released.1 We are already preparing a new test set for evaluating the new shared tasks. We hope to carry forward the learning from the first AutoMin and instigate more community attention and interest in this timely yet challenging problem. INLG, the premier forum for the NLG community, would be an appropriate venue to discuss the challenges and future of Automatic Minuting. The main objective of the AutoMin GenChal at INLG 2023 would be to come up with efficient methods to automatically generate meeting minutes and design evaluation metrics to measure the quality of the minutes.","authors":["Tirthankar Ghosal","Marie Hled\u00edkov\u00e1","Muskaan Singh","Anna Nedoluzhko","Ondrej Bojar"],"code":"static/paperfiles/paper30_code.zip","data":"static/paperfiles/paper30_data.zip","discord":"https://discordapp.com/channels/991043733573218384/994683942701641749","paper":"static/paperfiles/paper30_paper.pdf","session":"GenChal","start_time":"2022-07-21T11:30:00Z","time":"Thursday 07/21 11:30 EST","title":"The Second Automatic Minuting (Automin) Challenge: Generating And Evaluating Minutes From Multi-Party Meetings"},{"UID":"paper4","abstract":"We present a free online demo of THEaiTRobot, an open-source bilingual tool for interactively generating theatre play scripts, in two versions. THEaiTRobot 1.0 uses the GPT-2 language model with minimal adjustments. THEaiTRobot 2.0 uses two models created by fine-tuning GPT-2 on purposefully collected and processed datasets and several other components, generating play scripts in a hierarchical fashion (title $\rightarrow$ synopsis $\rightarrow$ script). The underlying tool is used in the THEaiTRE project to generate scripts for plays, which are then performed on stage by a professional theatre.","authors":["Rudolf Rosa","Patr\u00edcia Schmidtov\u00e1","Alisa Zakhtarenko","Ondrej Dusek","Tom\u00e1\u0161 Musil","David Mare\u010dek","Saad Obaid Ul Islam","Marie Nov\u00e1kov\u00e1","Kl\u00e1ra Voseck\u00e1","Daniel Hrbek","David Ko\u0161\u0165\u00e1k"],"code":"static/paperfiles/paper4_code.zip","discord":"https://discordapp.com/channels/991043733573218384/996467903161454694","full_video":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/728948556","paper":"static/paperfiles/paper4_paper.pdf","session":"Demo/Poster Session 2","slides":"static/paperfiles/paper4_slides.pdf","start_time":"2022-07-20T15:00:00Z","time":"Wednesday 07/20 15:00 EST","title":"Theaitrobot: An Interactive Tool For Generating Theatre Play Scripts"},{"UID":"paper28","abstract":"Recent research in the field of conversational AI has emphasized the need for standardization of the metrics used in evaluation. In this work, we focus on evaluation methods used for multi-party dialogue systems. We present an expanded taxonomy focusing on multi-party dialogue based on the need for evaluation dimensions that address challenges associated with the presence of multiple participants. We also survey the evaluation metrics utilized in current multi-party dialogue research, and present our findings with regards to inconsistencies within existing work. Furthermore, we discuss the subsequent need to have more consistent evaluation methodologies and benchmarks. We motivate how consistency will contribute towards a better understanding of progress in the field of multi-party dialogue systems.","authors":["Khyati Mahajan","Sashank Santhanam","Samira Shaikh"],"code":"static/paperfiles/paper28_code.zip","discord":"https://discordapp.com/channels/991043733573218384/994326800081637446","full_video":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/728954548","paper":"static/paperfiles/paper28_paper.pdf","session":"Oral Session 1","slides":"static/paperfiles/paper28_slides.pdf","start_time":"2022-07-19T14:40:00Z","time":"Tuesday 07/19 14:40 EST","title":"Towards Evaluation Of Multi-Party Dialogue Systems"},{"UID":"paper38","abstract":"","authors":["Rudali HUIDrom","Ondrej Dusek","Zden\u011bk Kasner","Thiago Castro Ferreira","Anya Belz"],"discord":"https://discordapp.com/channels/991043733573218384/996858160595882074","full_video":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/728955715","paper":"static/paperfiles/paper38_paper.pdf","poster":"static/paperfiles/paper38_poster.pdf","session":"GenChal","start_time":"2022-07-21T12:00:00Z","time":"Thursday 07/21 12:00 EST","title":"Two Reproductions Of A Human-Assessed Comparative Evaluation Of A Semantic Error Detection System"},{"UID":"paper21","abstract":"Typologically diverse languages offer systems of lexical and grammatical aspect that allow speakers to focus on facets of event structure in ways that comport with the specific communicative setting and discourse constraints they face. In this paper, we look specifically at captions of images across Arabic, Chinese, Farsi, German, Russian, and Turkish and describe a computational model for predicting lexical aspects. Despite the heterogeneity of these languages, and the salient invocation of distinctive linguistic resources across their caption corpora, speakers of these languages show surprising similarities in the ways they frame image content. We leverage this observation for zero-shot cross-lingual learning and show that lexical aspects can be predicted for a given language despite not having observed any annotated data for this language at all.","authors":["Malihe Alikhani","Thomas H Kober","Bashar Alhafni","Yue Chen","Mert Inan","Elizabeth Kaye Nielsen","Shahab Raji","Mark Steedman","Matthew Stone"],"code":"static/paperfiles/paper21_code.zip","discord":"https://discordapp.com/channels/991043733573218384/994326403917025290","full_video":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/729841361","paper":"static/paperfiles/paper21_paper.pdf","session":"Oral Session 3","slides":"static/paperfiles/paper21_slides.pdf","start_time":"2022-07-21T14:00:00Z","summary_video":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/729841279","time":"Thursday 07/21 14:00 EST","title":"Zero-Shot Cross-Linguistic Learning Of Event Semantics"}]
